# Stupendous

My personal blog's Ghost theme. Check out [my blog](http://dcefram.com) if ever you are curious as to
how this thing look like.

This theme only supports Blink based browsers (Chrome, Opera), Webkit (ie. Safari), Firefox, and IE10+ (including Edge). IE9 might be supported.

I don't plan to support older IE because those browsers will stay if websites still support it, even though those browsers are not maintained anymore.

# Note:
Version 2.0.0 will work only in Ghost 1.0.0. Please use earlier versions of this theme if you are using Ghost version 0.11.x.

## What's next?

I currently have a fulltime work, along with some other hobbies or other
'ventures'. Don't worry though, I'll get back to this project from time to time.

- Implement Search
- Implement Blog Cover, possibly similar to how casper does it (covers the whole page if the blog cover exists)
- Implement featured posts (I got no usecase for it right now, but it could be a good addition)
