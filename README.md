# Stupendous

A [ghost](https://ghost.org) and [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)
experiment. Initially forked from [Vapor](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor),
did some customization by adding some salt and pepper and then switched away
from less.

Check out [my blog](http://dcefram.com) if ever you are curious as to
how this thing look like.

This theme only supports Blink based browsers (Chrome, Opera), Safari, Firefox, and IE10+ (including Edge). IE9 might be supported.

I don't plan to support older IE because those browsers will stay if websites still support it, even though those browsers are not supported anymore

## What's next?

I currently have a fulltime work, along with some other hobbies or other
'ventures'. Don't worry though, I'll get back to this project from time to time.

- Implement Search
- Implement Blog Cover, possibly similar to how casper does it (covers the whole page if the blog cover exists)
- Implement featured posts (I got no usecase for it right now, but it could be a good addition)
